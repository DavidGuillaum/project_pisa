<h1 align="center">PISA 2012 Project</h1>

<p align="center">
This repository contains a project with the PISA dataset. This project is part of the Data Analysis nanodegree by Udacity.
<br>
The [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) project is led by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). This international group of the most economically developed country promotes policies that improve economic and social welfare. PISA stands for Program for International Student Assessment and the goal is to retrieve data about the education level (in mathematics, lecture, and natural sciences) of different countries (65) representing 28 million 15-year-old students (Population). Furthermore, it tries to identify the needs in terms of education of the economy. The gathering of data (with a survey of 510 000 students (Sample)) is done every 3 years. The data frame will deal with data from 2012. In our data frame, 44 of 65 countries answered a supplementary part about a creativity problem, and 18 countries about financial literacy. The dataset is too big for github so you must download it yourself: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelh/pisa-2012

- Part_II_exploration_PISA.ipynb #main file with the exploration parts
- df_dig.csv #cleaned data
- df_lang.csv #cleaned data
